This is a simple blog website built using MERN stack. It is listed in my portfolio to show my expertise my building full stack web applications. However, seeing the scope of this project, I will develop it more and hopefully open it to the public for their own uses soon.

To run this app locally you need have MongoDB installed and running it's shell service along with NodeJS and its package manager (npm).

1. You can clone the git respository. Run ``npm install`` in both the root folder and the **backend** folder.
2. Afterwards, run commands ``npm run dev`` and ``npm start`` in the root and backend directory respectively.
