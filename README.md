Hi! This project was built showcase my experstise in developing scalable full stack web applications.

## Technologies and Dependencies used
* MongoDB (Mongoose for communicating with Mongo)
* ExpressJS
* NodeJS (Implementation of RESTful APIs)
* ReactJS (That beautiful user interface)
* MUI styled components
* react-router-dom
* axios
* bodyParser
* cors

## Deployment
As of right now, the app can be locally hosted and the code is designed that way.
The backend would have to significantly altered in order to publish the app on some free hosting.
> Not to mention the prices

To run this app locally you need have MongoDB installed and running it's shell service along with NodeJS and its package manager (npm).

1. You can clone the git respository. Run ``npm install`` in both the root folder and the **backend** folder.
2. Afterwards, run commands ``npm run dev`` and ``npm start`` in the root and backend directory respectively.

* Any internal server errors are console logged while authentication or invalid URl are presented to the user.
